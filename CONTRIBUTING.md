# Contributing to Crikket

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Crikket.

This guide explains how to set up your local environment, make changes, and open high-quality pull requests.

## Code of Conduct

By participating, you agree to be respectful and constructive in discussions and reviews.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) (see `packageManager` in the root `package.json`)
- Git
- Environment variables for the app(s) you plan to run

## Project Structure

This repository is a Turborepo monorepo.

```
apps/
└── web
└── server
└── docs
└── extension
packages/
```

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone the repository.

2. Install dependencies from the repo root:

```bash
bun install
```

3. Set up environment files:

```bash
bun run setup:dev
```

This copies `apps/server/.env` and `apps/web/.env` from their examples and
auto-generates secrets. Fill in `DATABASE_URL` and the URL vars it flags.

The root `.env` is for Docker/self-hosting only and is not needed for local
dev. If you are working on the docs or extension apps, copy their env files
manually:

```bash
cp apps/docs/.env.example apps/docs/.env
cp apps/extension/.env.example apps/extension/.env
```

4. Start development:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Run a specific app when needed:

```bash
bun run dev:web
bun run dev:server
```

## Database Commands

From the repository root:

```bash
bun run db:generate
bun run db:migrate
bun run db:push
bun run db:studio
```

## Code Quality

This project uses [Ultracite](https://www.ultracite.ai) (Biome-based linting/formatting) and Turborepo type checks.

Before opening a pull request, run:

```bash
bun run fix
bun run check
bun run check-types
bun run build
```

## Making Changes

- Keep changes focused and scoped to a single feature or fix.
- Prefer small, reviewable pull requests.
- Follow existing code patterns and naming conventions.
- Update documentation when behavior, APIs, or setup steps change.

## Pull Request Guidelines

When opening a PR:

- Use a clear title that explains intent.
- Describe what changed and why.
- Include screenshots/videos for UI changes.
- Link related issues if applicable.

## Commit Convention

Before you create a Pull Request, please check whether your commits comply with
the commit conventions used in this repository.

When you create a commit we kindly ask you to follow the convention
`category(scope or module): message` in your commit message while using one of
the following categories:

- `feat / feature`: all changes that introduce completely new code or new
  features
- `fix`: changes that fix a bug (ideally you will additionally reference an
  issue if present)
- `refactor`: any code related change that is not a fix nor a feature
- `docs`: changing existing or creating new documentation (i.e. README, docs for
  usage of a lib or cli usage)
- `build`: all changes regarding the build of the software, changes to
  dependencies or the addition of new dependencies
- `test`: all changes regarding tests (adding new tests or changing existing
  ones)
- `ci`: all changes regarding the configuration of continuous integration (i.e.
  github actions, ci system)
- `chore`: all changes to the repository that do not fit into any of the above
  categories

  e.g. `feat(components): add new prop to the avatar component`
